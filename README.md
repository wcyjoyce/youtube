This is a simple YouTube video search app that I created with React as part of [Stephen Grider's](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) Modern React with Redux course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). Supported by [YouTube's API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/), users can instantly search for videos in this app.
